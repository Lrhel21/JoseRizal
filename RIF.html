      <h2>The Mercado - Rizal Family</h2>
        <div class="RF-b">
          <p>
            The Rizals is considered one of the biggest families during their time.
             Domingo Lam-co, the family's paternal ascendant was a full-blooded Chinese who came to the 
             Philippines from Amoy, China in the closing years of the 17th century and married 
             a Chinese half-breed by the name of Ines de la Rosa.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Researchers revealed that the Mercado-Rizal family had also traces
             of Japanese, Spanish, Malay and Even Negrito blood aside from Chinese.
          </p>
          <br />

  <h2>Early Childhood</h2>
   <div class="EC-b">
      <h3>In Calamba, Laguna</h3>
        <h4>19 June 1861</h4>
         <p>
          JOSE RIZAL, the seventh child of Francisco Mercado Rizal and Teodora Alonso y Quintos,
           was born in Calamba, Laguna.
          </p>
        <h4>22 June 1861</h4>
        <p>
          He was baptized JOSE RIZAL MERCADO at the Catholic of Calamba by the parish priest Rev.
           Rufino Collantes with Rev. Pedro Casañas as the sponsor.
        </p>
        <h4>28 September 1862</h4>
        <p>
          The parochial church of Calamba and the canonical books, including the book in which Rizal's 
          baptismal records were entered, were burned.
        </p>
        <h4>1864</h4>
        <p>
          Barely three years old, Rizal learned the alphabet from his mother.  
        </p>
        <h4>1865</h4>
        <p>
          When he was four years old, his sister Conception, the eight child in the Rizal family,
          died at the age of three. It was on this occasion that Rizal remembered having shed real 
          tears for the first time.        
        </p>
        <h4>1865 - 1867</h4>
        <p>
          During this time his mother taught him how to read and write. 
          His father hired a classmate by the name of Leon Monroy who, for five months until his (Monroy) death, 
          taught Rizal the rudiments of Latin.
          <br><br>
          At about this time two of his mother's cousin frequented Calamba. 
          Uncle Manuel Alberto, seeing Rizal frail in body, concerned himself with the physical development of
        his young nephew and taught the latter love for the open air and developed in him a great admiration
        for the beauty of nature, while Uncle Gregorio, a scholar,
        instilled into the mind of the boy love for education. He advised Rizal:
        "Work hard and perform every task very carefully; learn to be swift as well as thorough; be
        independent in thinking and make visual pictures of everything."   
        </p>
        <h4>6 June 1868</h4>
        <p>
          With his father, Rizal made a pilgrimage to Antipolo to fulfill the vow made by his mother to take the child 
          to the Shrine of the Virgin of Antipolo should she and her child survive the ordeal of delivery which nearly 
          caused his mother's life.<br><br>

          From there they proceeded to Manila and visited his sister Saturnina who was at the
           time studying in the La Concordia College in Sta. Ana.     
        </p>
        <h4>1869</h4>
        <p>
          At the age of eight, Rizal wrote his first poem entitled "Sa Aking Mga Kabata." 
          The poem was written in tagalog and had for its theme "Love of One's Language."       
        </p>

  <section class="Educ">
  <h2>Early Eucation in Calamba and Binan</h2>
   <div class="Educ-b">
    <p>
      Rizal had his early education in Calamba and Biñan. It was a typical schooling that
       a son of an ilustrado family received during his time, characterized by the four R's- reading, 
       writing, arithmetic, and religion. Instruction was rigid and strict. Knowledge was forced into
        the minds of the pupils by means of the tedious memory method aided by the teacher's whip. 
        Despite the defects of the Spanish system of elementary education, Rizal was able to acquire
         the necessary instruction preparatory for college work in Manila. It may be said that Rizal,
          who was born a physical weakling, rose to become an intellectual giant not because of, but rather in 
          spite of, the outmoded and backward system of instruction obtaining in the Philippines during
           the last decades of Spanish regime.    
    <h4>22 June 1861</h4>
    <p>
      The first teacher of Rizal was his mother,
     who was a remarkable woman of good character and fine culture.
     On her lap, he learned at the age of three the alphabet and the prayers.
     "My mother," wrote Rizal in his student memoirs, "taught me how to read and to
     say haltingly the humble prayers which I raised fervently to God."    
    </p>
    <p>
      As tutor, Doña Teodora was patient, conscientious, and understanding. 
      It was she who first discovered that her son had a talent for poetry. 
      Accordingly, she encouraged him to write poems. To lighten the monotony of memorizing the ABC's
       and to stimulate her son's imagination, she related many stories.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Jose grew older, his parents employed private tutors to give him lessons at home.
       The first was Maestro Celestino and the second, Maestro Lucas Padua. Later, an old man named Leon Monroy,
     a former classmate of Rizal's father, became the boy's tutor. This old teacher lived at the Rizal home
       and instructed Jose in Spanish and Latin. Unfortunately, he did not lived long. He died five months later.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a Monroy's death, the hero's parents decided to send their gifted son to a private school in Biñan.
    </p>
    <h4>Jose Goes to Biñan</h4>
    <p>
      One Sunday afternoon in June , 1869, Jose, after kissing the hands of his parents and 
      a tearful parting from his sister, left Calamba for Biñan. He was accompanied by Paciano , 
      who acted as his second father. The two brothers rode in a carromata, reaching their 
      destination after one and one-half hour's drive. They proceeded to their aunt's house, 
      where Jose was to lodge. It was almost night when they arrived, and the moon was about to rise.    
    </p>
    <p>
      That same night, Jose, with his cousin named Leandro, went sightseeing in the town. 
      Instead of enjoying the sights, Jose became depressed because of homesickness.
       "In the moonlight," he recounted, "I remembered my home town, my idolized mother,
        and my solicitous sisters. Ah, how sweet to me was Calamba, my own town, in spite of the fact that
       was not as wealthy as Biñan."
    </p>  
    <h4>First Day in Biñan School</h4>
    <p>
      The next morning (Monday) Paciano brought his younger brother 
      to the school of Maestro Justiniano Aquino Cruz.<br><br>

      The school was in the house of the teacher, which was a small
       nipa hut about 30 meters from the home of Jose's aunt.<br><br>
      
      Paciano knew the teacher quite well because he had been a pupil under him before.
       He introduced Jose to the teacher, after which he departed to return to Calamba.<br><br>

      
      Immediately, Jose was assigned his seat in the class. The teacher asked him:<br><br>
      
      "Do you know Spanish?"<br>
      "A little, sir," replied the Calamba lad.<br>
      "Do you know Latin?"<br>
      "A little, sir."<br><br>
      
      The boys in the class, especially Pedro, the teacher's son laughed at Jose's answers.<br><br>
      
      The teacher sharply stopped all noises and begun the lessons of the day.<br><br>
      
      Jose described his teacher in Biñan as follows: "He was tall, thin, long-necked,
       with sharp nose and a body slightly bent forward, and he used to wear a sinamay shirt, 
       woven by the skilled hands of the women of Batangas. He knew by the heart the grammars 
       by Nebrija and Gainza. Add to this severity that in my judgement was exaggerated and you have a picture,
        perhaps vague, that I have made of him, but I remember only this."<br><br>
      
      First School Brawl In the afternoon of his first day in school, when the 
      teacher was having his siesta, Jose met the bully, Pedro. He was angry at this bully
       for making fun of him during his conversation with the teacher in the morning.<br><br>
      
      Jose challenged Pedro to a fight. The latter readily accepted, thinking that 
      he could easily beat the Calamba boy who was smaller and younger.<br><br>
      
      The two boys wrestled furiously in the classroom, much to the glee of their classmates. 
      Jose, having learned the art of wrestling from his athletic Tio Manuel, defeated the bigger boy.
       For this feat, he became popular among his classmates.<br><br>
      
      After the class in the afternoon, a classmate named Andres Salandanan challenged him to an arm-wrestling match.
       They went to a sidewalk of a house and wrestled with their arms. Jose, having the weaker arm, 
       lost and nearly cracked his head on the sidewalk.<br><br>
      
      In succeeding days he had other fights with the boys of Biñan. He was not quarrelsome by nature,
       but he never ran away from a fight.<br><br>
       <h4>Best Student in School</h4>
    <p>
      In academic studies, Jose beat all Biñan boys. He surpassed them all in Spanish, Latin, and other subjects.<br><br>
      Some of his older classmates were jealous of his intellectual superiority.
       They wickedly squealed to the teacher whenever Jose had a fight outside the school, 
       and even told lies to discredit him before the teacher's eyes. Consequently the teacher had to punish Jose.   
   </p>
    <h4>Early Schooling in Biñan</h4>
    <p>
      Jose had a very vivid imagination and a very keen sense of observation.
       At the age of seven he traveled with his father for the first time to Manila and thence 
       to Antipolo to fulfill the promise of a pilgrimage made by his mother at the time of his birth.
        They embarked in a casco, a very ponderous vessel commonly used in the Philippines.
         It was the first trip on the lake that Jose could recollect. As darkness fell he spent the hours by the katig,
          admiring the grandeur of the water and the stillness of the night, although he
           was seized with a superstitious fear when he saw a water snake entwine itself around 
           the bamboo beams of the katig. With what joy did he see the sun at the daybreak as its luminous 
           rays shone upon the glistening surface of the wide lake, producing a brilliant effect! With what joy 
           did he talk to his father, for he had not uttered a word during the night!    </p>
    <p>
      When they proceeded to Antipolo, he experienced the sweetest emotions upon
       seeing the gay banks of the Pasig and the towns of Cainta and Taytay. In Antipolo he prayed,
        kneeling before the image of the Virgin of Peace and Good Voyage, of whom he would later sing in elegant verses.
         Then he saw Manila, the great metropolis , with its Chinese sores and European bazaars. 
         And visited his elder sister, Saturnina, in Santa Ana, who was a boarding student in the Concordia College.    
   </p>
    <p>
      At the age of eight, Rizal wrote his first poem entitled "Sa Aking Mga Kabata." 
      The poem was written in tagalog and had for its theme "Love of One's Language."       
    </p>
    <p>
      When he was nine years old, his father sent him to Biñan to continue studying Latin,
       because his first teacher had died. His brother Paciano took him to Biñan one Sunday, 
       and Jose bade his parents and sisters good-bye with tears in his eyes. Oh, how it saddened him to leave
        for the first time and live far from his home and his family! But he felt ashamed to cry and had to conceal
         his tears and sentiments. "O Shame," he explained, "how many beautiful and pathetic scenes
          the world would witness without thee!"    </p>
      <p>
        They arrived at Biñan in the evening. His brother took him to the house of his aunt where he was to stay,
         and left him after introducing him to the teacher. At night, in company with his aunt's grandson named Leandro,
          Jose took a walk around the town in the light of the moon.
           To him the town looked extensive and rich but sad and ugly.      
      <p>
      <p>
        His teacher in Biñan was a severe disciplinarian.
         His name was Justiniano Aquino Cruz. "He was a tall man, lean and long-necked,
          with a sharp nose and a body slightly bent forward. He used to wear a sinamay
           shirt woven by the deft hands of Batangas women. He knew by memory the grammars of Nebrija and Gainza.
            To this add a severity which, in my judgement I have made of him, which is all I remember."      
      </p>
      <p>
        The boy Jose distinguished himself in class, and succeeded in surpassing many of his older classmates. 
        Some of these were so wicked that, even without reason, they accused him before the teacher, for which,
         in spite of his progress, he received many whippings and strokes from the ferule. 
         Rare was the day when he was not stretched on the bench for a whipping or punished with five or six blows
          on the open palm. Jose's reaction to all these punishments was one of intense resentment
           in order to learn and thus carry out his father's will.      
      </p>
       
        <p>
          Jose spent his leisure hours with Justiniano's father-in-law, a master painter.
           From him he took his first two sons, two nephews, and a grandson. His way life was methodical and
            well regulated. He heard mass at four if there was one that early, or studied his lesson at that 
            hour and went to mass afterwards. Returning home, he might look in the orchard for a mambolo fruit to eat,
             then he took his breakfast, consisting generally of a plate of rice and two dried sardines.        
        </p>
          <p>
            After that he would go to class, from which he was dismissed at ten, then home again.
             He ate with his aunt and then began at ten, then home again. He ate with his aunt and then began to study.
              At half past two he returned to class and left at five. He might play for a short time with some 
              cousins before returning home. He studied his lessons, drew for a while, and then prayed and if there
               was a moon, his friends would invite him to play in the street in company with other boys.<br><br>

            Whenever he remembered his town, he thought with tears in his eyes of his beloved father, 
            his idolized mother, and his solicitous sisters. Ah, how sweet was his town even though
             not so opulent as Biñan! He grew sad and thoughtful.          
          </p>
            <p>
              While he was studying in Biñan, he returned to his hometown now and then.
               How long the road seemed to him in going and how short in coming! When from afar he descried the roof of his house,
                secret joy filled his breast. How he looked for pretexts to remain longer at home!
                 A day more seemed to him a day spent in heaven, and how he wept, though silently and secretly, 
                 when he saw the calesa that was flower that him Biñan! Then everything looked sad; a flower that he touched, 
                 a stone that attracted his attention he gathered, fearful that he might not see it again upon his return.
                  It was a sad but delicate and quite pain that possessed him.

  <h2>Philosophies in Life</h2>
   <div class="Phil-b">
         <p>
          PHILOSOPHY may be defined as the study and pursuit of facts which
           deal with the ultimate reality or causes of things as they affect life.<br><br>

          The philosophy of a country like the Philippines is made up of the intricate and 
          composite interrelationship of the life histories of its people; in other word, 
          the philosophy of our nation would be strange and undefinable if we do not delve into the past
           tied up with the notable life experiences of the representative personalities of our nation.<br><br>
          
          Being one of the prominent representatives of Filipino personalities,
           Jose Rizal is a fit subject whose life philosophy deserves to be recognized.<br><br>
          
          Having been a victim of Spanish brutality early in his life in Calamba,
           Rizal had thus already formed the nucleus of an unfavorable opinion of Castillian
            imperialistic administration of his country and people.<br><br>
          
          Pitiful social conditions existed in the Philippines as late as three centuries
           after his conquest in Spain, with agriculture, commerce, communications and education 
           languishing under its most backward state. It was because of this social malady that social evils
            like inferiority complex, cowardice, timidity and false pride pervaded nationally and contributed
             to the decay of social life. This stimulated and shaped Rizal's life phylosophy to be to contain 
             if not eliminate these social ills.<br><br>
          </p>
        <h4>Educational Philosophy</h4>
        <p>
          Rizal's concept of the importance of education is clearly enunciated 
          in his work entitled Instruction wherein he sought improvements in the schools
           and in the methods of teaching. He maintained that the backwardness of his country during
            the Spanish ear was not due to the Filipinos' indifference, apathy or indolence as claimed by the rulers, 
            but to the neglect of the Spanish authorities in the islands. For Rizal, the mission of education 
            is to elevate the country to the highest seat of glory and to develop the people's mentality. 
            Since education is the foundation of society and a prerequisite for social progress, Rizal claimed 
            that only through education could the country be saved from domination.<br><br>

          Rizal's philosophy of education, therefore, centers on the provision of proper 
          motivation in order to bolster the great social forces that make education a success,
           to create in the youth an innate desire to cultivate his intelligence and give him life eternal.<br><br>
        </p>
        <h4>Religious Philosophy</h4>
        <p>
          Rizal grew up nurtured by a closely-knit Catholic family, 
          was educated in the foremost Catholic schools of the period in the elementary,
           secondary and college levels; logically, therefore, he should have been a propagator of strictly
            Catholic traditions. However, in later life, he developed a life philosophy of a different nature, 
            a philosophy of a different Catholic practice intermingled with the use of Truth and Reason.
        </p>
        <h4>Political Philosophy</h4>
        <p>
          In Rizal's political view, a conquered country like the Philippines should not
           be taken advantage of but rather should be developed, civilized, educated and trained in 
           the science of self-government.<br><br>

        He bitterly assailed and criticized in publications the apparent backwardness 
        of the Spanish ruler's method of governing the country which resulted in:<br><br>

        1.the bondage and slavery of the conquered;<br>
        2.the Spanish government's requirement of forced labor and force military service upon the n natives;<br>
        3.the abuse of power by means of exploitation;<br>
        4.the government ruling that any complaint against the authorities was criminal; and <br>
        5.Making the people ignorant, destitute and fanatic, thus discouraging the formation of a national sentiment.
        Rizal's guiding political philosophy proved to be the study and application of reforms, the extension of 
        human rights, the training for self government and the arousing of spirit of discontent over oppression, 
        brutality, inhumanity, sensitiveness and self love. <br><br>

        Rizal's guiding political philosophy proved to be the study and application of reforms, 
        the extension of human rights, the training for self government and the arousing of spirit of 
        discontent over oppression, brutality, inhumanity, sensitiveness and self love.<br>
        </p>
        <h4>Ethical Philosophy</h4>
        <p>
          The study of human behavior as to whether it is good or bad or whether it is right or wrong is that
           science upon which Rizal's ethical philosophy was based. The fact that the Philippines was under Spanish
            domination during Rizal's time led him to subordinate his philosophy to moral problems. 
            This trend was much more needed at that time because the Spaniards and the Filipinos had different and 
            sometimes conflicting morals. The moral status of the Philippines during this period was one with a lack of
             freedom, one with predominance of foreign masters, one with an imposition of foreign religious worship, devotion,
              homage and racial habits. This led to moral confusion among the people, what with justice being stifled,
               limited or curtailed and the people not enjoying any individual rights.<br><br>

              To bolster his ethical philosophy, Dr. Rizal had recognized not only the forces of good and evil,
               but also the tendencies towards good and evil. As a result, he made use of the practical method
                of appealing to the better nature of the conquerors and of offering useful methods of solving 
                the moral problems of the conquered.<br><br>
              
              To support his ethical philosophy in life, Rizal:<br><br>
              
             1. censured the friars for abusing the advantage of their position as spiritual leaders 
             and the ignorance and fanaticism of the natives;<br>
             2. counseled the Filipinos not to resent a defect attributed to them but to accept same as reasonable and just;<br>
             3. advised the masses that the object of marriage was the happiness and love of the couple and not financial gain;<br>
             4. censured the priests who preached greed and wrong morality; and<br>
             5. advised every one that love and respect for parents must be strictly observed.<br>
        </p>
        <h4>Social Philosophy</h4>
        <p>
          That body of knowledge relating to society including the wisdom which man's experience
           in society has taught him is social philosophy. The facts dealt with are principles involved in nation
            building and not individual social problems. The subject matter of this social philosophy covers the problems 
            of the whole race, with every problem having a distinct solution to bolster the people's social knowledge.<br><br>

          Rizal's social philosophy dealt with;<br><br>
          
          1.man in society;<br>
          2.influential factors in human life;<br>
          3.racial problems;<br>
          4.social constant;<br>
          5.social justice;<br>
          6.social ideal;<br>
          7.poverty and wealth;<br>
          8.reforms;<br>
          9.youth and greatness;<br>
          10.history and progress;<br>
          11.future Philippines.<br><br>
          The above dealt with man's evolution and his environment, explaining for the most part human behavior and capacities
           like his will to live; his desire to possess happiness; the change of his mentality; the role of virtuous women 
           in the guidance of great men; the need for elevating and inspiring mission; the duties and dictates of man's conscience;
            man's need of practicing gratitude; the necessity for consulting reliable people; his need for experience; 
            his ability to deny; the importance of deliberation; the voluntary offer of man's abilities and possibilities; 
            the ability to think, aspire and strive to rise; and the proper use of hearth, brain and spirit-all of these combining to enhance 
            the intricacies, beauty and values of human nature. All of the above served as Rizal's guide in his 
            continuous effort to make over his beloved Philippines.<br>

  <h2>Rizal's Lovelife</h2>
<div class="Ll-b">
<p>There were at least nine women linked with Rizal; namely Segunda Katigbak,
   Leonor Valenzuela, Leonor Rivera, Consuelo Ortiga, O-Sei San, Gertrude Beckette, 
   Nelly Boustead, Suzanne Jacoby and Josephine Bracken. These women might have been
    beguiled by his intelligence, charm and wit.
  </p>

<h4>4 Segunda Katigbak and Leonor Valenzuela</h4>
<p>Segunda Katigbak was her puppy love. Unfortunately, his first love was engaged to be
   married to a town mate- Manuel Luz. After his admiration for a short girl in the person of Segunda, 
   then came Leonor Valenzuela, a tall girl from Pagsanjan. Rizal send her love notes written in invisible ink,
    that could only be deciphered over the warmth of the lamp or candle. He visited her on the eve of his departure 
    to Spain and bade her a last goodbye.</p>

<h4>Leonor Rivera</h4>
<p>Leonor Rivera, his sweetheart for 11 years played the greatest influence in keeping him
   from falling in love with other women during his travel. Unfortunately, Leonor's mother
    disapproved of her daughter's relationship with Rizal, who was then a known filibustero. 
    She hid from Leonor all letters sent to her sweetheart. Leonor believing that Rizal had already 
    forgotten her, sadly consented her to marry the Englishman Henry Kipping, her mother's choice.</p>

<h4>Consuelo Ortiga</h4>
<p>Consuelo Ortiga y Rey, the prettier of Don Pablo Ortiga's daughters, fell in love with him. 
  He dedicated to her A la Senorita C.O. y R., which became one of his best poems. 
  The Ortiga's residence in Madrid was frequented by Rizal and his compatriots. He probably fell in
   love with her and Consuelo apparently asked him for romantic verses. He suddenly backed out
    before the relationship turned into a serious romance, because he wanted to remain loyal to
     Leonor Rivera and he did not want to destroy hid friendship with Eduardo de Lete who was madly
      in love with Consuelo.</p>

<h4>O Sei San</h4>
<p>O Sei San, a Japanese samurai's daughter taught Rizal the Japanese art of painting known
   as su-mie. She also helped Rizal improve his knowledge of Japanese language. If Rizal was a man 
   without a patriotic mission, he would have married this lovely and intelligent woman and 
   lived a stable and happy life with her in Japan because Spanish legation there offered him a lucrative job.</p>

<h4>Gertrude Beckett</h4>
<p>While Rizal was in London annotating the Sucesos de las Islas Filipinas, he boarded in the 
  house of the Beckett family, within walking distance of the British Museum. Gertrude, a blue-eyed
  and buxom girl was the oldest of the three Beckett daughters. She fell in love with Rizal. 
  Tottie helped him in his painting and sculpture. But Rizal suddenly left London for Paris to 
  avoid Gertrude, who was seriously in love with him. Before leaving London, he was able to finish the
   group carving of the Beckett sisters. He gave the group carving to Gertrude as a sign of their brief relationship.</p>

<h4>Nellie Boustead</h4>
<p>Rizal having lost Leonor Rivera, entertained the thought of courting other ladies. 
  While a guest of the Boustead family at their residence in the resort city of Biarritz, 
  he had befriended the two pretty daughters of his host, Eduardo Boustead. Rizal used to fence
   with the sisters at the studio of Juan Luna. Antonio Luna, Juan's brother and also a 
   frequent visitor of the Bousteads, courted Nellie but she was deeply infatuated with Rizal. 
   In a party held by Filipinos in Madrid, a drunken Antonio Luna uttered unsavory remarks against Nellie Boustead.
    This prompted Rizal to challenge Luna into a duel. Fortunately, Luna apologized to Rizal, 
    thus averting tragedy for the compatriots.<br><br>

  Their love affair unfortunately did not end in marriage. It failed because Rizal refused to
   be converted to the Protestant faith, as Nellie demanded and Nellie's mother did not like a physician 
   without enough paying clientele to be a son-in-law. The lovers, however, parted as good 
   friends when Rizal left Europe.</p>

<h4>Suzanne Jacoby</h4>
<p>In 1890, Rizal moved to Brussels because of the high cost of living in Paris. In Brussels, 
  he lived in the boarding house of the two Jacoby sisters. In time, they fell deeply in love with each other.
   Suzanne cried when Rizal left Brussels and wrote him when he was in Madrid.</p>
<h4>Josephine Bracken</h4>
<p>In the last days of February 1895, while still in Dapitan, Rizal met an 18-year old petite Irish girl,
   with bold blue eyes, brown hair and a happy disposition. She was Josephine Bracken, 
   the adopted daughter of George Taufer from Hong Kong, who came to Dapitan to seek Rizal for 
   eye treatment. Rizal was physically attracted to her. His loneliness and boredom must have taken 
   the measure of him and what could be a better diversion that to fall in love again.
    But the Rizal sisters suspected Josephine as an agent of the friars and they considered her
     as a threat to Rizal's security.<br><br>

  Rizal asked Josephine to marry him, but she was not yet ready to make a decision due to her 
  responsibility to the blind Taufer. Since Taufer's blindness was untreatable, he left for Hon Kong on March 1895.
   Josephine stayed with Rizal's family in Manila. Upon her return to Dapitan, Rizal tried to arrange with
    Father Antonio Obach for their marriage. However, the priest wanted a retraction as a precondition 
    before marrying them. Rizal upon the advice of his family and friends and with Josephine's consent took her
     as his wife even without the Church blessings. Josephine later give birth prematurely to a stillborn baby,
      a result of some incidence, which might have shocked or frightened her.</p>
